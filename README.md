# Beaglebone-RTC-Buzzer-Cape
Use Maxim **DS1338C** with **CR-2032** battery holder for real-time clock
I use Diptrace for schematic and layout. There are gerber ad NC drill files in Production folder. Schematic and layout files are in Hardware folder. There also comes with UART2 TX & RX connector for communication. You can use use on board JST 2.0mm pitch connector for Beaglebone 5V power.
